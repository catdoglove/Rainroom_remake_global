diary
"I looked up and saw something falling down from the sky. When I reached out to catch it, it was pure white snow. When tasted it, it was sweet. Turned out that cotton candy was falling from the sky."
"Everything was dark. I walked and walked endlessly in the dark, towards the dimly lit place. No matter how much I walked, I was just standing in the same place. I couldn't get any closer and just woke up from the dream."
The large table was full of food that I could only find in books. I didn't dare touch them. Would I deserve it? I just sat in a chair and stared.
"The world was turned upside down. I was standing in the sky and everything was above me. Or is it the other way around? When I woke up, I couldn't tell if I was upside down or if they were upside down."
"I was hanging from a ladder to the sky. The wind blew, but I climbed up with a single desire to hold onto it and face upwards. When I reached the top, there was nothing there. I found out that all of it was pointless."
"I looked up and saw something falling down from the sky. When I reached out to catch it, it was pink petals. Looking up at the sky, there were large cherry blossoms. As the wind blew, it seemed like the pink rain."
I was lying in space and my body was floating. It was dark around but various stars became road in the dark. It was so beautiful.
"The rain stopped in the sky, there was no cloud, and the sunshine was on me.  I saw myself in the puddle. I was smiling."
"I dreamed that the world would be destroyed. The building collapsed, the walls and floors cracked, and everything disappeared. I was just staring from above."
"I laughed for a long time at someone. When I approach them, they move away, and when I stay still, they stay still too. I wanted to check what they were, but I woke up from a dream."
"Looking at the ground, something was rising up. When I reached out and touched it, it was water. The water was going back up to the sky. The rain was getting ready to fall again."
"After walking and walking endlessly in a bright white space, I arrived in a faintly dark place. It was a small hole. I looked into it with my eyes, but I couldn't see anything."
"There were empty plates on a large table. When I reached for one, it broke easily. One began to break, and all the dishes broke one after another. I ran away from that place."
"The room was filled with water because of the rain. The water was knee-deep and everything was a mess. Looking outside, everything was flooded."
"I was climbing the wall at the mountain. The wind blew, but I ignored it and went up. I kept going up, but I couldn't see the top of a mountain. When I wanted to go down, I came back down automatically."
"It rained heavily in only one place. The other place was clean without a cloud, but only one place was raining. That was a single room where I lived."
"I was swimming in the sea under the night sky. When I swam forward through the water reflected by the starlight, I felt that I was seeing the Milky Way. I don't know where I was swimming."
"There was not a cloud after the rain stopped, and the sunlight greeted me in the sky. I felt a little sad that the rain had stopped. I think I've grown attached to the rain."
"I was flying above the clouds. The sunset was here, and the surroundings were getting darker. When the surroundings became dark, the moon appeared and shone on me. I woke up from my dream as I was flying to the moon."
"I was walking while holding someone's hand. We were walking along, having many talks. When it was time to say goodbye, I held hands because that was a shame. You have to wake up from your dream. I woke up at the same time as someone said."
"Someone kept chasing me but I couldn't see it. So I kept running. I stopped short of breath, and when I looked back, there was nothing. I looked forward again and woke up from a dream. The last thing I saw was darkness."
"I stood in the desert. The desert was surrounded by dry land and cacti. I was getting tired of the heat. Then I saw an oasis in the distance and ran. When I arrived, only then did I know that it was a mirage."
There was a lot of snow and I touched it but it wasn't cold. I lay down on the snow and felt warm. The snow was piled on top of my body and it felt good.
"I walked toward the bright spot. When I arrived, I saw myself. I smiled at myself and woke up in a dream."
"There was continued thunder from the sky. I couldn't go outside in the room, and I was just looking through the window. Suddenly, a big thunder fell before my eyes, and I woke up from my dream."
I was floating on the sea. The sun was shining and I wore sunglasses because it was so bright. A calm wave pushed me away. It was a cool feeling.
"There were small white puppies around, and their fur looked soft. I tried to reach out and pat it, but it bit my hand. I woke up in a dream in surprise."
"Cats seemed to be sitting, sleeping, or not interested. As I approached, the cats ran away one by one. I had no choice but to stare from afar."
"I rode on a huge balloon and flew in the sky. The balloon was shrinking, but it stayed in the sky. I woke up watching the balloon that was smaller than my body."
"I was walking while holding someone's hand. We were walking along, having many talks. After a long talk, he looked at me. Then I awoke from my dream."
"Someone kept chasing me. So I kept running away. When I looked back, there was a little puppy chasing me. I looked forward with relief, and I woke up in a dream when I saw something dark."
"I stood in the desert oasis and looked inside. I was curious about the clear water. I carefully soaked my feet, but I didn't feel anything. Only then did I know that it was a mirage."
I was flying in the snowy sky. I looked down and saw the snowflakes softly falling. I woke up looking at that.
"I walked toward the bright spot. When I arrived, there was a big mirror. But It couldn't reflect me. I couldn't tell if it was a mirror or not."
I was flying above the clouds and met the birds. A very large bird was flying by me and quickly disappeared forward. So I flew away alone.
I could open my eyes and breathe in the sea. I looked around and saw fish swimming that I only saw in books. The coral reefs were beautiful.
"There were small white puppies around, and their fur looked soft. I reached out and patted it and they looked good. I patted them and woke up in a dream."
"Cats seemed to be sitting, sleeping, or not interested. As I approached and sat down, one came up on my lap. I patted a cat and woke up in a dream."
"I was flying in a hot air balloon. I could see the sun setting in the distance. I could only hear the sound of the surrounding wind. Leaving myself in the wind, I flew toward the sun."
"There were rainbow flowers around. The flowers were swaying in the wind. When I looked closely, I could smell the flower?ì…² aroma."
"The window broke and the wind blew. As I followed the wind, there was another large window. I opened the window and found another broken window."
I was sitting around the campfire roasting marshmallows. The night sky was full of stars. There was only the sound of firewood burning around. I woke up from a dream when I saw marshmallows being roasted.
"Something was chasing me from behind, and I was runaway. Then the bird emerged from the sky, gave me a ride and flew away. I flew through the sky, relieved and leaving myself in the wind."
"There was a lot of fruit around. I caught sight of a tangerine and picked it up. When I tasted it, it tasted like an apple. The other was the same. I woke up from a dream while tasting a tangerine that tasted like an apple."
I arrived in a country of chocolate and candy. The floor was made of candy tiles and chocolate fell from the sky instead of rain. I looked around with an umbrella-shaped candy. I felt the sweetness.
"I was standing on the ice and skating. Skating was difficult for me because it was my first time. I got better and better, and I went on looking around."
I looked at the ground and saw something coming up. I reached out and touched it and it was snow. Snow covered buildings and cars. Buildings and cars began to freeze. The whole world was frozen with ice.
"I was going to my favorite dessert cafe a long way from home. I arrived a few hours later, but the cafe was closed. I wanted to go to another cafe, but all the cafes were closed."
" the food varied and many people were crowded. I went to the toilet to wash my hands before eating. I woke up from a dream when I was about to go back to my seat.."""
"I was walking in the woods. The trees I saw in the book were full of forests and there were various plants. At that time, I woke up from my dream when my eyes met an animal with white fur."
"When I woke up from a dream and looked around, something was strange. Then I woke up from the dream and looked around again, and it was also a dream. I still seem to be in a dream."
"I heard noise around me. I covered my ears and crouched down because of the loud noise. I closed my eyes and opened them again, and woke up from my dream. I realized again the importance of quietness."
"The surroundings were all bright, but not dazzling. I had an interesting talk with someone, but when I woke up from my dream and couldn't remember."
I went out for a walk in the park with an umbrella. A cat stared at me and suddenly started talking to me. I was so surprised that I woke up from the dream.
"As usual, I stayed in the room. When I was bored, I turned on the TV. The weather forecast told me it would be sunny all through this week. Then I noticed it was a dream."
I saw something in the window. I came close and looked closely. And I saw a gray whale. The whale was floating by my room. I can't forget the whale's eyes.
"I rode up the river in a small carving boat from the sea. I continued it and arrived at my room. The room had turned into a lake, and I woke up as I tried to put my hand in the water."
There was a sea in the night sky and stars were in the sea. The stars were floating along the waves. I was walking on the water. Maybe I was walking through space.
The large and colorful trees were planted all over the park. The leaves blowing in the wind seemed to rain in rainbow colors of rain.
The bubbles were floating around me. There were memories in the bubbles. I touched it because I wanted to see the memories and the bubbles burst right away. The rest of the bubbles burst one by one and I woke up.
